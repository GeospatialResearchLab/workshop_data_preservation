## Abstract

Digital data doesn’t always stay put. Websites change, tools disappear, and valuable datasets can quietly slip offline—sometimes forever. In this Scary Data Week workshop, you’ll learn how to bring data “back from the dead” using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. We’ll explore how and why datasets vanish, walk through the steps of preserving webpages, and give you the chance to reanimate a dataset of your own. No technical experience required—just curiosity, a laptop, and a willingness to protect public knowledge from the digital grave. Whether you’re a researcher, student, or data enthusiast, you’ll leave this session with practical skills and a deeper understanding of the role you can play in preserving civic information.
